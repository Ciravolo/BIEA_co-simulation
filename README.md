# Thesis 
This project contains all the files related to my thesis work.

University: University of Pisa

Course fo Study: MSc. Computer Engineering

Title: "A Framework for Validation of a Bio-Inspired Exploration Algorithm in Multi-Robot Scenarios."

The project contains the FMI packages that can be used to generate the project FMUs, by mean of the make file contained inside them. All these FMI package has been generated using PVSio-Web version developed by Gabriele Scoma (https://github.com/mapalmieri/pvsio-web/tree/scoma) and the code inside them has been implemented by me during the thesis work. The folder "BIEA_DETERMINISTIC/" contains the FMUs that implement a deterministic version of the bio-inspired algorithm taken as case-study. The folder "BIEA_STOCHASTIC/" contains the FMUs that implement the probabilistic version of the algorithm.  

The folder "into-cps-project/" contains the project that can be imported directly inside INTO-CPS to perform a co-simulation

The folder "BIEA_interface/" contains a graphical user-interface for the configuration of the INTO-CPS multi-model related to the BIEA INTO-CPS project.

The folder "GraphicalEnvironment/" provides a graphical support view for the 2-D visualisation of the co-simulation.
